trafficRobot.tk website, @trafficRobot chatbot and TrafficRobot browser extension
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last updated: 2017-08-28


Privacy of anyone using the website, bot or browser extension is number one priority.
Website might have 3rd party stats gathering embedded (like Google Analytics or Yandex Metrika),
which have their own privacy policies. But besides that, TrafficRobot is not trying to match
user's analytical data to their physical identities (like, IP or geoposition) or collect any data
which can help do so.

Traffic Robot does not collect/save any information about the user, besides the very minimum to carry
on its duties. In particular:

* Application has all logging explicitly turned off (including access logs and error logs)
* Application perceives users only as randomized ids without any connection to their IPs, geoposition etc.
* Data passed through from one user to another is not saved, and gets pushed instantly to destination
* Data passed through is not analyzed or modified in any way
* Emails received, for convinience, are stored in unique secret web urls (known only to receivers)
  for up to 12 hours (for receiver's convenience) and get destroyed irreversibly afterwards


Nor NSA, nor any other government institution ever gotten access to TrafficRobot with ability to read
end users' comminication or ability to de-anonymize end users.

Creator of TrafficRobot never received any requests from NSA or any other government institution to provide
access to TrafficRobot's end users data.
